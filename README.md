#### sign-language-detector.py
### Problem statememt
#### People with hearing or speech impairments often face difficulties in expressing their thoughts and interacting with others.Sign-Language is a powerful tools for them, but since it is not widely understood by the general population.To address this issue, there is a need for a real-time sign language detection system.

### Proposed Solution
#### This project proposes a " Sign Language Dectection System " that can identify hand gestures in real-time and convert them into text ,additionally there is an AI assistant that converts text to speech.

#### Functionality and concepts use:
This project contains Python,Mediapipe, and Speech Recognition, the system is designed to accurately detect hand landmarks, and map them to corresponding words.Following are few concept used in this system:

- Mediapipe Hand Tracking : Detects and tracks hand landmarks for gesture analysis.
- Feature Extraction : Hand landmarks are processed to identify unique patterns for each gestures.
- Speech Recognition : Converts detected text into voice ouput for better accessibility.
- Python Libraries : Utilized for building, training, and integrating the sysytem components.
